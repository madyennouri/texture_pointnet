1. Setup:
bashCopy# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv texture_env
source texture_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: texture_env\Scripts\activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Training:
bashCopypython train.py --data_path data/ml_dataset.mat --output_dir results

3. Evaluation:
bashCopypython evaluate.py --model_path results/best_model.pth --output_dir results

4. Hyperparameter Tuning:
bashCopypython hypertuning.py --data_path data/ml_dataset.mat --output_dir results/tuning

5. Baseline Comparison:
bashCopypython baseline_comparison.py --model_path results/best_model.pth --output_dir results/comparison


Notes

- The implementation assumes that your Fourier coefficients can be meaningfully treated as points in a point cloud. The adapted version of PointNet++ treats each coefficient as a point with a single feature.
- I've simplified the set abstraction mechanism from the original PointNet++ to work better with 1D data, but it still maintains the hierarchical structure.
- The code includes comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualization tools to help you understand your model's performance.
- The hyperparameter tuning script allows you to systematically search for the best model configuration.
- The baseline comparison helps you quantify the advantage of using PointNet++ over simpler models.
